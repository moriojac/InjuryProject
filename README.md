        <b>Data Cleaning and Preparation</b>
        <p style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          With the mix of manual organizing and the help of AI tools, all data from the Word document detailing 52 worship services was extracted and transferred to a CSV file.

        <b>Data Visualization & Storytelling</b>
        <p style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          Data is manipulated into several visualizations, categorized into two sections:
          <br> <br/><b>Worship Service Insights:</b> Allows users to search by name to access a compiled overview of their service contributions.
        </p>
      </div>
    </td>

      <div>
        <img src="InjuryProject_P4.png" style="width: 90%; height: 320px; object-fit: cover;" />
        <b>Interpretation & Decision-Making</b>
        <p style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          The goal of this data is to provide insights into worship service participation, allowing users to explore trends and recognize contributions within the music ministry.
