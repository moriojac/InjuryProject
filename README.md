          With the mix of manual organizing and the help of AI tools, all data from the Word document detailing 52 worship services was extracted and transferred to a CSV file.

        <b>Data Visualization & Storytelling</b>
        <h6 style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          Data is manipulated into several visualizations, categorized into two sections:
          <br> <br/><b>Worship Service Insights:</b> Allows users to search by name to access a compiled overview of their service contributions.
           <br> <br/><b>Musician Leaderboard:</b> Showcases the top musicians for each musical role.

        <b>Interpretation & Decision-Making</b>
        <h6 style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          The goal of this data is to provide insights into worship service participation, allowing users to explore trends and recognize contributions within the music ministry.
        <br><br> Insights from the data can help worship leaders make informed decisions, such as balancing musician rotations, identifying frequently played songs, and recognizing key               contributors to each service
